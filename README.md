# Traffic_Sign_prediction-CNN-
It is a Convolutional neural network which identifies traffic signs, mostly used in self driving cars.

Prediction Of traffic signs Using Convolutional Neural networks.Convolutional neural networks or ConvNets or CNNâ€™s are very important to learn if you want to pursue a career in the computer vision field. CNN help in running neural networks directly on images and are more efficient and accurate than many of the deep neural networks. ConvNet models are easy and faster to train on images comparatively to the other model.
